# Hyperliquid Stats

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Using Docker Compose for Development

To simplify the setup and ensure consistency across different development environments, you can use Docker Compose to run the project. This method requires Docker and Docker Compose to be installed on your machine.

1. Build the Docker images:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

2. Start the services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the Next.js development server and any other services defined in your `docker-compose.yml`, such as Nginx or a database, making them accessible via `http://localhost:3002` or another port specified in your Docker Compose configuration.

To stop the services, use:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
